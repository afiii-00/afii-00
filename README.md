# Hi! I'm Adrian 👋

Hi! I'm Adrian Hanafi, a student at STIKOM El Rahma.
I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and the basics of web development.

This GitHub profile is where I upload my practice projects, experiments, and everything I build as I continue improving my skills.
I'm still at the beginning of my learning journey, but I'm excited to grow step by step and create better projects along the way.

Saya masih belajar, jadi kalau ada masukan atau saran, feel free buat kirim issue atau DM!
